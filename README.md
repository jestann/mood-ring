# mood-ring

This project was part of a hackathon team effort in January 2018 to build an IOT real-time sensor and app integration from the ground up. We were aiming to build a heart rate tracker to help support self monitoring and developing good routines for people with anxiety.

Our integration relied on the following tech: Arduino, Python, Anaconda, Jupyter, Google Firebase, Node.js, React, Chart.js, and R charting.
